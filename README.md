# A glimpse of my undergraduate thesis project â€“ Data Visualization

## Introduction

In order to graduate with BSc. in Engineering Physics, I had to write a thesis project. My supervisor and 
I chose a topic related to the environment: Wildfires in the state of Yucatan :mexico:.

The thesis project was focused on gathering, cleaning, exploring and visualizing data concerning wildfires 
(time series, records and environmental data). Some sources were public data from government institutions, 
specialized databases and satellite imagery :artificial_satellite: :earth_americas:.

With this repository, I aim to redesign some (not all) of my favourite and relevant data visualizations I 
created for my undergrad thesis. Some of the new designs are going to showcase a better picture of the 
data, and other perhaps are going to explore my creativity and desire to _play_ with shapes, colours and 
concepts; therefore, any constructive feedback will be receive.
