# Redesigning Data Visualizations: A glimpse of my undergraduate thesis project.

## Introduction

In order to graduate with BSc. in Engineering Physics, I had to write a thesis project. My supervisor and
I chose a topic related to the environment üå± : **Wildfires in the state of Yucatan** üá≤üáΩ

The thesis project was focused on gathering, cleaning, exploring and visualizing data concerning wildfires
(time series, records and environmental data). Some sources were public data from government institutions,
specialized databases and satellite imagery üõ∞Ô∏è :earth_americas:

With this repository, **I aim to redesign some (not all) of my favourite and relevant data visualizations I
created for my undergrad thesis**. Some of the new designs will showcase a different picture of the
data, and others perhaps will explore my creativity and desire to _play_ with shapes, colours and
concepts. Therefore, no matter the case, I will receive feedback.

See the whole project in my portfolio ["Redesigning Data Visualizations: Undergrad Thesis"](https://unisaacarroyov.myportfolio.com/redesigning-data-visualizations-undergrad-thesis)
