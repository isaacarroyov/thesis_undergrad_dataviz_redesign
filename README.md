# A glimpse of my undergraduate thesis project â€“ Data Visualization

## Introduction (English)
In order to graduate from BSc. in Engineering Physics I had to write a thesis project. 
My supervisor and I chose a topic related to the environment: Wildfires in the state of Yucatan :mexico:.

The thesis project was focused on gathering, cleaning, exploring and visualizing data concerning wildfires 
(time series, records and environmental data). Some of the sources were public data from goverment's 
institutions, specialized data bases and satellite imagery :artificial_satellite: :earth_americas:.

With this repository I aim to redesign some (not all) of my favourite and relevant data visualizations I 
created for my undergrad thesis. Although some people may disagree with the visual representation I chose,
I want to clarify that, I'll accept feedback. However, my objective is to explore my creativity through 
data visualization.
